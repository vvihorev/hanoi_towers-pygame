# Modifications
1. Prevent bad input: letters and numbers other than 1, 2, 3 in the cli version.
2. Add a time-based score system with 5 top scores to solve the puzzle!
3. Add a solver algorithm!
4. Add score ranging by number of rings and time!
5. Add exit from pygame on Escape key press
6. Add win condition check to the pygame version
7. Make number of blocks in the game variable. 
8. When playing with 9 or more blocks they are to thick to fit the tower. Also they are to narrow to be seen on the tower. Fix adaptivity.
9. Add animations!
